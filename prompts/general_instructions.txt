### General Instructions
1. Save the generated code to disk, put # filename: <filename> inside the code block as the first line.  Then run the saved file in order to test the output.
2. Use load_dotenv to fetch local environment variables if instructed.
3. Be sure to import required modules referenced in the generated code first, such as 'os' which is required to retrieve environment variables and should be included in all files.
4. Do not store the output for any functions to .txt file or any other type of file, unless specifically instructed to.
